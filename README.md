# Description
This are my notes, that I gathered from my search in the world of learning to play the piano and the guitar (Classical and electric). <br>
I speak about music theory, I speak about sight reading, I speak about practice, about good books, good Youtube channels and about configurations on Linux. I leave in Portugal and also tried to find the best cheap solution for piano and guitar, the best bang for the buck. All products have to works well on Linux and my localization impacted my choices, they were the best solutions for me, but maybe aren't the best solutions for you. But there is a really good and solid info here about learning to play those instruments. <br>
The objective of learning to play an instrument, should be, the enablement of the production of beauty in the world though music.


# Music theory
It’s the foundation of all music, you can learn an instrument by ear and imitation or by a more profound and better way, you can learning music theory, by books or trough a teacher. In here, I’m looking on the more economic side of things so I’m not talking much of getting a private teacher because they can be several times as expensive as the initial cost of an instrument. So not accessible to all. Music theory is the foundation of all music, is it’s alphabet and it’s grammar. So my main resources for are primary books, Youtube channels and sites.

# Guitar
The beautiful string instrument :-D


## Finding a good and economic guitar

The guitars that I like that are good and economic are from: <br>

* APC Instruments – António Pinto de Carvalho <br>
  [https://apc-instruments.com/](https://apc-instruments.com/) 

* Thomann's brand, the Harley Benton’s good and economic guitars <br>
  [https://harleybenton.com/](https://harleybenton.com/) 

* And Yamaha C70 Classical guitar <br>
  [https://europe.yamaha.com/en/products/musical_instruments/index.html](https://europe.yamaha.com/en/products/musical_instruments/index.html) 


## Solutions for the big hands or the fat fingers problem.

I live in Portugal and APC Instruments - António Pinto de Carvalho - that is the largest European Luthier, and it's headquarters and production is in Braga Portugal. They do guitars by hand, they makes guitars of all types, shapes and sizes at good prices. A typical classical guitar nut is 52 mm and for large hands or fat fingers, that can be too small, but if you ask APC they will take there normal line of 7 (60mm nut) or 8 strings (70mm nut) guitars and apply a 6 string custom bridge and a custom nut, so that you can have a large inter string distance in the 6 strings. They do this for just, a really small amount.


## How to tune your guitar

Use a tuner or a tuner APP and tune to the following mnemonic notes for each string. <br>
<br>

**E**ddie - Higher string position <br>
**A**te <br>
**D**ynamite <br>
**G**ood <br>
**B**ye <br>
**E**ddie - Lower position string <br>
 <br>
Higher position string ____ **E** - **A** - **D** - **G** - **B** - **E** ____ Lower position string


## Sight Reading with the guitar

Sight reading requires that you read at least 4 to 5 pages, of different guitar sheet music every day, for several months. And it’s a skill that if you stop practicing you will be worst at it, so you have to always keep practicing it. The best book for guitar sight reading that I know of is the: <br>

* A Modern Method for Guitar: Volumes 1, 2, and 3 - Berklee <br>
  by William Leavitt

It’s 424 pages of gradually increasing in difficult guitar sheet music in a large font. <br>
<br>
A good video to learn sight reading is this one:<br>
<br>
* The Piano Sight Reading Tricks You Need to Know for Easier Playing <br>
  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A6NcbSJpHU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A6NcbSJpHU) 

The most difficult part of playing the guitar is to memorize all notes on the fret for the 6 strings. <br>
<br>
For sight reading, there are the following techniques (see the piano section for more details): <br>

1. First you will have to start by memorizing a music peace (first parts, then all the music) because you can not sight read it fast enough in real time at the beginning.

2. You will start to recognize patterns in the structure of the music, parts that repeat and parts that are similar in form, so that you can more easily localize yourself on the music and compress the music more easily in your mind. Recognizing what is the same and what only has little differences, it’s patterns.

3. You have to know the notes on the G clef by heart, and the upper and lower 4 to 5 ledger lines, but that is really simple, with the book I recommend in this section, from Berklee. We have to know this process, but it is slow to do in real time, so wee will have other tricks to minimize it’s use, but it’s the foundation.

4. You have to learn to read music not by each note name or value, but by it’s interval in regard to the previous note. That will make you read much faster and will allow you to find patterns in music and patterns in the repetition and moving of the intervals in consecutive notes. The normal process is to detect the first note in the horizontal lines of the staff and then the others, you will try to detect it’s intervals in regard to the previous note. First is a C, next is upper 3º, lower 2º, upper 5º, lower 7º. Normally you only have to remember by heart the 1º, 2º, 3º, 4º, 5º, 6º, 7º and 8º (octave) intervals. And them pattern in the consecutive notes, example the next 4 notes are pairs of 2 notes with an interval of 2 between them and they are going up in steps of interval of one along the staff. 

5. After learning to recognize the intervals instantly, you will need to do the some for chords. Example, you will determine that the root position of the chord is a C and then you will learn to see that the upper two notes are in intervals of 2. This makes the recognition of the chords much faster. <br>

See all the videos from the music Youtube channel LeCheileMusic <br>

1. We have to be looking always a little bit in front of what we are currently playing to have time to sight read the music sheet and to have time to process it.

2. We have to learn the fret board by heart, see the book and do scales: 

* Guitar Fretboard Workbook 2nd Edition <br>
  by Barrett Tagliarino

8. We have to practice a lot, in order to we can use muscle memory to place and move our hands on the fret board rapidly and almost without looking, so we can look at the sheet of music continually.

# Piano
The king of all instruments :-D


## Adult piano learning

It’s never to late to learn tom play the piano :-D <br>
To play the piano you will use all your brain capacity, all your sight, all your earing, all your movement coordination, and the best thing is that this training and practice will make your sharper, mentally more active and more in control of your abilities. It will also sharp your senses and make you see the world in a different way. You will see even more beauty in the world. <br>
<br>

To see the different difficulty levels of piano music, see: <br>

## How to start learning the piano even if you don’t have a piano, the paper piano

Even if you don’t have a Piano, and even if you don’t have a 50 dollars MIDI Keyboard Controller connected to a computer (Linux, Windows or Mac) or mobile phone, you can also start to learn how to play the instrument. Just draw a paper keyboard layout on two or tree sheets of paper and put tape between the sheets. To now the correct keyboard measurements of an octave, then it repeats to the right and to the left, see: <br>

* Musical keyboard <br>
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_keyboard#Size_and_historical_variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_keyboard#Size_and_historical_variation) 

 <br>
“Modern piano keyboards ordinarily have an octave span of 164–165 mm (6.5–6.5 in), resulting in the width of black keys averaging 13.7 mm (0.54 in) and white keys about 23.5 mm (0.93 in) at the base, disregarding space between keys.” <br>
<br>

And then play with with your fingers with the paper piano, along this play list: <br>

## Finding a good and cheap piano or MIDI Controller that works on Linux

1. If money isn’t a limitation, then go wild and get your self a good grand acoustic piano, from the best brands: Steinway, Kawai, Yamaha, Fazioli, C. Bechstein, Petrof, Steingraeber, Grotrian, Blüthner.

1. But money is always a limitation :-D The second best thing is an upright acoustic piano. But they are also not very cheap and require that you call a piano technician, to tune your piano 2 times a year, so they have high maintenance costs. Your have all the normal brands like Kawai and Yamaha and others. And if you leave in a apartment, you cannot play at earlier or late hours in the day, because a piano is something loud. No phones syndrome :-D

2. The next best thing, is to find, what in my humble opinion, are the best 2 digital pianos in terms of keybed and in terms of sound, but not very cheap: <br>

* Kawai CA99 (furniture home piano) <br>
  [https://www.kawai-global.com/product/ca99/](https://www.kawai-global.com/product/ca99/) 

* Kawai MP11SE (very heavy stage piano, built like a tank) <br>
  [https://www.kawai-global.com/product/mp11se/](https://www.kawai-global.com/product/mp11se/) 

4. The next best thing, is the cheap KORG D1 that has the very best keybed even when comparing to the sub 1200 euros range of pianos, and this piano is for the price of the most entry level pianos on the market. But has the same keybed that the KORG Kronos at 7x times the price and the same that the KORG Grand Stage at 4x it’s price tag. The sound is good, but for the best sound you can connect it to a computer or a Raspberry Pi and use the free and high quality piano sound fonts that I list below. It has a MIDI DIN Out that you can connect via a cheap 5 bucks converter to USB computer. It weights 16.5Kg and is built like a tank. See the video below.

* Korg D1 Digital Piano - Better Music <br>
  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j5YEw9SjKU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j5YEw9SjKU) 

* One example of a MIDI to USB adapter that is class compliant and works on Linux. <br>
  Swissonic MidiConnect 2 <br>
  [https://www.thomann.de/pt/swissonic_midiconnect_2.htm](https://www.thomann.de/pt/swissonic_midiconnect_2.htm) 

5. The next best thing, is a MIDI Keyboard Controller, you can choose a heavy weighted keys MIDI Controller or a synth keys MIDI Controller. In this regard, I have search so many controllers but my current best option for a good controller, at a low price, that as a solid solid built and is USB Class compliant, so that it can work well with no drivers on Linux. The touch of the keys is nice for the price. They are:

* Swissonic EasyKey 49

* Swissonic EasyKey 61  (I would choose this one) 5.6 Kg Aluminum chassis <br>
  [https://www.thomann.de/pt/swissonic_easykey_61.htm](https://www.thomann.de/pt/swissonic_easykey_61.htm) 

See the following video: <br>

* Video - J:ME PLAY 61 TEST ----- Swissonic EasyKey 61 <br>

* Swissonic ControlKey 88    Semi-weighted - 11.6 Kg Aluminum chassis

To generate the piano sound, you can connect to your computer and use it’s internal audio interface or use a good and cheap external USB Linux compatible audio interface like the following two alternatives, and use the speakers or the headphones: <br>

* Swissonic UA-2x2 <br>
  [https://www.thomann.de/pt/swissonic_ua_2x2.htm](https://www.thomann.de/pt/swissonic_ua_2x2.htm) 

* Behringer U-Phoria UMC202HD <br>
  [https://www.thomann.de/pt/behringer_u_phoria_umc202hd.htm](https://www.thomann.de/pt/behringer_u_phoria_umc202hd.htm) 

Good quality and comfortable the headphones, that can go down to 16 Hz so that you can ear, with easy, even the lowest piano music note the A2 – 27 Hz: <br>

* AKG K-92 <br>
  [https://www.thomann.de/pt/akg_k_92.htm](https://www.thomann.de/pt/akg_k_92.htm) 

Then for a good piano sound, use the free and really good piano sound fonts, that works even on Linux or Raspberry Pi (and windows and MAC). See the section below. <br>

To see how to configure all this on Linux, see the corresponding section below. <br>

6. Lower price that this, you can have a paper piano that you can see as a really interesting option to start to learn the piano, if you can’t afford a 50 dollars MIDI Keyboard Controller, but you have access to a internet connection or a mobile phone. See the previous section.


## Finding good sound fonts or SFZ's for the piano that work on Linux, Windows, Mac and Raspberry Pi.

There are 2 ways to produce a good piano sound with a computer or an electronic device, you can record many wave samples at different velocities (from quieter to louder) that will be played when you press a key or you can physically model and simulate a piano with mathematics and physics. 


### High quality and free sound font’s of several pianos

My criterion for a piano sound font is that it should be free, it should be a high quality piano sound and that it should work on Linux. If it works on Linux, it also works on Windows and Mac and Raspberry Pi. <br>
 <br>
You can see several free SFZ Piano instruments in here: <br>
<br>
The **huge Salamander piano** <br>
**Yamaha C3**, **C5** e **CF-3** <br>
**Steinway model D**, **model B** and others <br>
**Clav** ... and **Rhodes** <br>
**Wurlitzer** EP203W electric piano <br>
**Yamaha CP80** Electric Grand <br>
**Hohner Pianet T** <br>

* Instruments | Pianos <br>

There is also an incredible community, that makes good sampled virtual pianos and have that have several high quality free pianos, see for example the UpRight Spring Piano of Schimmel and others.

* pianobook - Comunity <br>
  [https://www.pianobook.co.uk/library/category/pianos/](https://www.pianobook.co.uk/library/category/pianos/) 

Or the great and beautifully sampled piano with a binaural 10.000 dollars microphone: <br>

  [https://www.pianobook.co.uk/library/family-grand/](https://www.pianobook.co.uk/library/family-grand/) 


### Physically modeled or simulated sound of a piano.

This is the best quality method for the highest realistic piano sound that you can have, but currently there is no open source software to generate a modeled piano, in my opinion the best modeled or simulated pianos are from: <br>

* Modartt: Virtual instruments, physically modelled <br>
  Pianoteq <br>
  [https://www.modartt.com/pianoteq?tab=instruments](https://www.modartt.com/pianoteq?tab=instruments) 

Then you can always develop one that will be open source, to know more about how a piano is physically modeled see the online books:

## Sight Reading with the piano

Sight reading requires that you read at least 4 to 5 pages of different piano sheet music every day for several months, and it’s a skill that if you stop practicing you will become worst at it, so you have to always keep practicing it. <br>
 <br>
The best video to learn sight reading is this one:<br>
<br>

* The Piano Sight Reading Tricks You Need to Know for Easier Playing <br>
  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A6NcbSJpHU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A6NcbSJpHU)

The most difficult part of playing the piano by sight reading, unlike the guitar, is not the memorize of all notes on the fret for the 6 strings. In comparison to the guitar, the piano keyboard layout is much simpler, your only have to know one octave, and after that the mapping of notes repeats lower and upper in the register. But in the piano, you will be juggling with many more thing at the same time, first you have the staff lines for the clef off G and the clef of F, then you have two independent rhythms, independent notes and times for each hands 5 fingers. And you have much more notes on the ledger lines to memorize. <br>
<br>
For sight reading there are the following techniques: <br>

1. First, you will start by memorizing a music peace (first parts, then all the music) because at the beginning you will not sight read it fast enough in real time.

2. You will start to recognize patterns in the structure of the music, parts that repeat and parts that are similar in form in the music sheet, so that you can more easily localize yourself on the music and compress the music more easily in your mind. Recognizing what is the same and what only has little differences, it’s patterns.

3. You have to know the notes on the G clef staff and on the F clef staff by heart, and the upper and lower 4 to 5 ledger lines. We have to know this process, but it is slow to do in real time, so wee will have other tricks to minimize it’s use, but it’s the foundation.

4. You have to learn to read music, not by each note name or value, but by it’s interval in regard to the previous note. That will make you read much faster and will allow you to find patterns in music and patterns in the repetition and moving of the intervals in consecutive notes. The normal process is to detect the first note in the horizontal lines of the staff and then the others you will try to detect it’s distance interval in regard to the previous note. First is a C, next is upper 3º, lower 2º, upper 5º, lower 7º. Normally you only have to remember by heart the 1º, 2º, 3º ,4º, 5º, 6º, 7º and 8º (Octave) intervals. And them the pattern in the consecutive notes, example the next 4 notes, are pairs of 2 notes with an interval of 2º and they are going up in steps of intervals of one along the staff lines. 

5. After learning to recognize the intervals instantly, you need to do the some for chords, example you determine that the root position of the chord is a C and then you learn to see that the upper two notes are in intervals of 2. This makes the recognition of the chords much faster. <br>

See all the videos from the music Youtube channel LeCheileMusic <br>

6. We have to be looking always, a little bit in front of what we are currently playing to have time to sight read the music sheet and to have time to process it.

7. Like with a PC keyboard, if you can already type fast, you can type without looking at the computer keyboard. The same happens, with time with the Piano, and this is very important because to sight read at normal speed you have to keep your eyes on the music sheet and not on the piano keys. This is very important for speed. So, how do you train yourself to not looking at the piano? You can make a “aparatus” out of cardboard that covers the piano keys giving you a small distance for your hands movements. And at the beginning try to find your location, with the sense of touch, from the different block of black keys in the octave. With time you will learn it by heart and you will not remove your eyes from the music sheet. See this process here:

  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXS4PBd59BE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXS4PBd59BE) 

8. You have to practice a lot, so we can use muscle memory to place and move, the right and left hand and fingers to produce the respected interval between sequence notes and chords without looking at the keys of the piano.

  [https://www.thomann.de/pt/behringer_u_phoria_umc202hd.htm](https://www.thomann.de/pt/behringer_u_phoria_umc202hd.htm) 

They also have a headphones output with volume control and you can connect to them a instrument Hi-Z Jack (example Electric Guitar or Acustic / Classical Guitar internal sound system). Or externally you can connect a Condenser Microphone (2 channels XLR with 48V fantom power to up to two microphone) to record directly you acoustic guitar sounds or tour vocals.


# Finding a good and cheap microphone for vocals and classical or acustic guitar

In the market there are very good and very expensive large diaphragm condenser microphones, one of the best of the not incredible expensive ones is the: <br>

# Disclaimer

I talk about diferente products, because after a long and dificult search for good solutions that are low cost but have quality, those ones, where the ones I choose for me, I payed them with my money and they are not a payed advertise. The fact that for me they all have to work on Linux is another parameter that I have always in my mind when choosing a product. Normally, the manufactor, doesn't tell you, that it works in Linux or that it is USB Class Compliant, a sign that it will work, so you have to dig deeper into foruns, reviews and the internet in general. That was what I did heavilly.
